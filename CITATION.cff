abstract: "Foundation models trained at scale exhibit remarkable emergent behaviors, 
  learning new capabilities beyond their initial training objectives. We find such emergent 
  behaviors in biological vision models via large-scale contrastive vision-language training. 
  To achieve this, we first curate TreeOfLife-200M, comprising 214 million images of living 
  organisms, the largest and most diverse biological organism image dataset to date. We then 
  train BioCLIP 2 on TreeOfLife-200M to distinguish different species. Despite the narrow 
  training objective, BioCLIP 2 yields extraordinary accuracy when applied to various biological 
  visual tasks such as habitat classification and trait prediction. We identify emergent 
  properties in the learned embedding space of BioCLIP 2. At the inter-species level, the 
  embedding distribution of different species aligns closely with functional and ecological 
  meanings (e.g. beak sizes and habitats). At the intra-species level, instead of being diminished, 
  the intra-species variations (e.g. life stages and sexes) are preserved and better separated 
  in subspaces orthogonal to inter-species distinctions. We provide formal proof and analyses 
  to explain why hierarchical supervision and contrastive objectives encourage these emergent 
  properties. Crucially, our results reveal that these properties become increasingly significant 
  with larger-scale training data, leading to a biologically meaningful embedding space."
